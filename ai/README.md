## Auto-generation of sequential Keras models:
Used technologies:
<br>
**_Python, Pymoo, Tensorflow/Keras_**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code utilises Tensorflow library and NSGA2 genetic algorhitm from Pymoo to automatically generate a sequential neural network, based on the input data. At the beggining, user can narrow down the number of possible models by setting some of the global variables such as MAX_LAYER_SIZE etc. After running the desired number of epochs, the program returns a set of optimal candidates, trying to balance the efficiency and size of the model.

## Simple neural network library:

Used technologies:
<br>
**_C++, Make(optional)_**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a set of C++ classes allowing to create a simple multilayer perceptron. It can be trained on numerical data and solve simple mathematical problems. There are two included examples presenting the possibilities of the program. The project includes a makefile giving the user an option to install the classes as a static library.
